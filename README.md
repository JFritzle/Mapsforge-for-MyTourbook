# Mapsforge-for-MyTourbook
Graphical user interface between Mapsforge tile server and MyTourbook

### Preliminary
MyTourbook supports offline Mapsforge maps as _2.5D Tour Maps_ out of the box using VTM (Vector Tile Map) renderer. Prebuilt Mapsforge maps are provided amongst others by [mapsforge.org](http://download.mapsforge.org) and [openandromaps.org](https://www.openandromaps.org).

MyTourbook however is also able to handle _2D Tour Maps_ provided as raster tiles by a Tile Map Service (TMS), which is mainly used by web mapping servers. To make local Mapsforge maps nevertheless available as _2D Tour Maps_ within MyTourbook, a local tile server can be set up to render these Mapsforge maps and to interact with MyTourbook via TMS protocol. The corresponding tile server is available at this [mapsforgesrv](https://github.com/telemaxx/mapsforgesrv) repository.

### Graphical user interface
This project’s intension is to easily let the user interactively and comfortably select the numerous available options of tile server. In addition, option settings as well as position and font size of graphical user interface automatically get saved and restored. Tile server and MyTourbook get started/restarted using these options without need to manually set up any configuration files. 

Graphical user interface is a single script written in _Tcl/Tk_ scripting language and is executable on _Microsoft Windows_ and _Linux_ operating system. Language-neutral script file _Mapsforge-for-MyTourbook.tcl_ requires an additional user settings file and at least one localized resource file. Additional files must follow _Tcl/Tk_ syntax rules too.

User settings file is named _Mapsforge-for-MyTourbook.ini_. A template file is provided.

Resource files are named _Mapsforge-for-MyTourbook.<locale\>_, where _<locale\>_ matches locale’s 2 lowercase letters ISO 639-1 code. English localized resource file _Mapsforge-for-MyTourbook.en_ and German localized resource file _Mapsforge-for-MyTourbook.de_ are provided. Script can be easily localized to any other system’s locale by providing a corresponding resource file using English resource file as a template.

4. Alternative Marlin rendering engine (optional)  
[Marlin](https://github.com/bourgesl/marlin-renderer) is an open source Java2D rendering engine optimized for performance.  
For Java version 11 or higher, open [mapsforgesrv](https://github.com/telemaxx/mapsforgesrv) repository, switch branch to _master_, navigate to folder _mapsforgesrv/libs_ and download jar file(s) _marlin-*.jar_.  
For Java version 8, open [mapsforgesrv](https://github.com/telemaxx/mapsforgesrv) repository, switch branch to _Java8_, navigate to folder _mapsforgesrv/libs_ and download jar file(s) _marlin-*.jar_.  
Windows: Copy downloaded jar file(s) into Mapsforge tile server’s installation folder, e.g. into folder _%programfiles%/MapsforgeSrv_.  
Linux: Copy downloaded jar file(s) into Mapsforge tile server’s installation folder, e.g. into folder _~/MapsforgeSrv_.  

5.	Tcl/Tk scripting language version 8.6 or higher binaries  
Windows: Download and install latest stable version of Tcl/Tk. See https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/Binary+Distributions for available binary distributions. Recommended distribution is [teclab’s tcltk](https://github.com/teclab-at/tcltk/releases) repository. First select most recent installation file _tcltk86-8.6.x.y.tcl86.Win10.x86_64.tgz_, then press _Download_ button. Unpack zipped tar archive (file extension _.tgz_) into your Tcl/Tk installation folder, e.g. _%programfiles%/Tcl_.  
Note 1: [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org) file archiver/extractor is able to unpack _.tgz_ archives.   
Note 2: Archives of latest releases for Windows at teclab’s tcltk repository may have file extension _.zip_ while they should have extension _.tgz_. Rename extension to _.tgz_ before unpacking archive.  
Linux: Install packages _tcl, tcllib, tk_ and _tklib_ using Linux package manager. Package _tklib_ is required for tooltips. (Ubuntu: _apt install tcl tcllib tk tklib_)

6.	Mapsforge maps  
Download Mapsforge maps for example from [openandromaps.org](https://www.openandromaps.org). Each downloaded OpenAndroMaps map archive contains a map file (file extension _.map_). Tile server will render this map file.  

7.	Mapsforge themes  
Mapsforge themes _Elevate_ and _Elements_ (file extension _.xml_) suitable for OpenAndroMaps are available for download at [openandromaps.org](https://www.openandromaps.org).  
Note:  
In order "Hillshading on map" to be applied to rendered map tiles, hillshading has to be enabled in theme file too. _Elevate_ and _Elements_ themes version 5 or higher do enable hillshading.

8. DEM data (optional, required for hillshading)  
Download and store DEM (Digital Elevation Model) data for the regions to be rendered.
Notes:  
Either HGT files or ZIP archives containing 1 equally named HGT file may be supplied.  
Example: ZIP archive N49E008.zip containing 1 single HGT file N49E008.hgt.  
While 1\" (arc second) resolution DEM data have a significantly higher accuracy than 3\" resolution, hillshading assumes significantly much more time. Therefore 3\" resolution usually is better choice.  
    
   \- HGT files with 3\" resolution SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) data are available for whole world at [viewfinderpanoramas.org](http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/Coverage%20map%20viewfinderpanoramas_org3.htm). Unzip downloaded ZIP files to DEM folder.  
\- HGT files with 1\" resolution DEM data are available for selected regions at [viewfinderpanoramas.org](http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/Coverage%20map%20viewfinderpanoramas_org1.htm). Unzip downloaded ZIP files to DEM folder.  
\- ZIP archives with 3\" and 1\" resolution compiled and resampled by Sonny are available for selected regions at [Sonny's Digital LiDAR Terrain Models of European Countries](https://sonny.4lima.de). LiDAR data where available are more precise than SRTM data. Store downloaded ZIP files to DEM folder.

9.	Mapsforge for MyTourbook graphical user interface script  
Download language-neutral script file _Mapsforge-for-MyTourbook.tcl_, user settings file _Mapsforge-for-MyTourbook.ini_  and at least one localized resource file.  
Windows: Copy downloaded files into Mapsforge tile server’s installation folder, e.g. into folder _%programfiles%/MapsforgeSrv_.  
Linux: Copy downloaded files into Mapsforge tile server’s installation folder, e.g. into folder _~/MapsforgeSrv_.  
Edit _user-defined script variables settings section_ of user settings file _Mapsforge-for-MyTourbook.ini_ to match files and folders of your local installation of Java, Mapsforge tile server and MyTourbook.  
Important:  
Always use character slash “/” as directory separator in script, for Microsoft Windows too!

### Script file execution

Windows:  
Associate file extension _.tcl_ to Tcl/Tk window shell’s binary _wish.exe_. Right-click script file and open file’s properties window. Change data type _.tcl_ to get opened by _Wish application_ e.g. by executable _%programfiles%/Tcl/bin/wish.exe_. Once file extension has been associated, double-click script file to run.

Linux:  
Either run script file from command line by
```
wish <path-to-script>/Mapsforge-for-MyTourbook.tcl
```
or create a desktop starter file _Mapsforge-for-MyTourbook.desktop_
```
[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Type=Application
Terminal=false
Name=Mapsforge-for-MyTourbook
Exec=wish <path-to-script>/Mapsforge-for-MyTourbook.tcl
```
or associate file extension _.tcl_ to Tcl/Tk window shell’s binary _/usr/bin/wish_ and run script file by double-click file in file manager.

### Usage

* After selecting map(s), theme file, theme style, style's overlays etc. in graphical user interface, hit _Start_ button to start tile server and MyTourbook. After MyTourbook has started successfully, activate MyTourbook's map _Mapsforge_ to show map(s) selected in graphical user interface. If changing any settings while MyTourbook is running, a restart of tile server is required to adopt new option settings. To restart server, hit _Start_ button again. As MyTourbook may be configured to cache tiles already loaded with previous settings, it is necessary to clear MyTourbook's tile cache, which happens at restart too. After restart, right-click MyTourbook's 2D Tour Map and force MyTourbook to reload failed map images or by zooming in and out via mouse wheel.
* Closing either graphical user interface or MyTourbook window will close tile server too.
* Use keyboard keys Ctrl-plus to increase and keyboard keys Ctrl-minus to decrease font size of graphical user interface and/or output console.
* See output console for tile server’s and MyTourbook's output.

### MyTourbook integration

Import _2D Map_ map provider files with Drag&Drop or _Import_ button in the preference page for _2D Map_ map providers:
* File _mapsforgemap.xml_ defines _2D Map_ custom map provider _MapsforgeMap_ fetching map tiles from tile server.
* File _mapsforgehillshading.xml_ defines _2D Map_ custom map provider _MapsforgeHillshading_ fetching alpha-transparent hillshading tiles from tile server if selected in graphical user interface.
* File _mapsforgemaphillshading.xml_ defines _2D Map_ map profile _MapsforgeMapHillshading_ which composes Mapsforge server's map tiles with Mapsforge server's alpha-transparent hillshading.

Set map provider _MapsforgeMapHillshading_ visible, whether hillshading  in graphical user interface is enabled or not and whether "Hillshading on map" or "Hillshading as map" is selected in graphical user interface.

Custom map provider _MapsforgeHillshading_ can also be used in other map profiles to supply map with alpha-transparent hillshading, e.g. OpenStreetMap. File _openstreetmaphillshading.xml_ defines _2D Map_ map profile _OpenStreetMapHillshading_ which composes MyTourbook's built-in map provider OpenStreetMap with Mapsforge server's alpha-transparent hillshading.

Note:  
Zoom levels shown in _Map Profile Configuration_ are one higher than zoom levels internally used by query to the Mapsforge tile server.

### Hints

* Built-in world map  
Since the built-in [Mapsforge world map](https://download.mapsforge.org/maps/world/world.map) only shows the coastline, it only serves as a rough overview. Due to map's low resolution, coastlines show inaccurate at high resolution. Because the Mapsforge renderer prefers land on the world map to sea on the selected detailed local map, it may be advisable to disable the built-in world map when rendering coastal regions at high resolution.
* Hillshading  
  * When selecting "Hillshading on map", map and hillshading are rendered  into one single map. Flat area gets a medium shade of gray, while slopes get a darker or a brighter shade of gray depending on the angle of incidence of light. Thus map has a shade of gray everywhere.  
  * When selecting "Hillshading as map", map and hillshading are rendered as two separate maps. Post-processing hillshading, gray value of flat area gets mapped to full transparency, darker gray values get mapped to transparency levels of black, brighter gray values get mapped to transparency levels of white. Thus the flatter the area, the more the original colors of the map shine through. Finally, hillshading can be used as an alpha-transparent overlay for any map.  
[OpenTopoMap](https://opentopomap.org) uses this same hillshading technique.
